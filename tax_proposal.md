### Set On-Chain Tax Rate to 1.5%

This is a proposal to ***increase the on-chain tax rate from 0.5% to 1.5%***, and to leave it in place until a total supply ***target of 10B LUNC*** (10,000,000,000) is reached. 

With the 80/20% tax split this would be a tax breakdown of: 

- ***1.2% burn tax***
- ***0.15% to the community pool***
- ***0.15% to the oracle pool*** 

The existing 0.5% tax is split:       

- 0.4% burn tax
- 0.05% to the community pool
- 0.05% to the oracle pool. 

This proposal for a 1.5% tax would:

- ***3x the burn tax rate***, from 0.4% to 1.2%
- ***3x the rate of community pool funding*** from the tax, from 0.05% to 0.15%
- ***3x the rate of oracle pool funding*** from the tax, from 0.05% to 0.15%. 

We can expect a ***substantial increase in the rate of LUNC and USTC burns*** from the tax, the community pool funding rate, and funding to the oracle pool for long term staking rewards. 

The proposed ***1.5% tax rate is a taxation rate better suited to the goals of our chain*** in reaching our target supply and in the continual long term funding of the community pool and oracle pool. 

The increased burn tax rate provides ***opportunity for a renewed effort towards off-chain burn tax adoption***. 

With the recent implementation of the improved tax handling upgrade, ***double taxation of dapp contracts is eliminated***, the burden of technical issues in dealing with the on-chain tax is removed, and CW20 token transfers are already tax exempt. 

With LUNC and the wider market in the early stages of expected bullish conditions, the ***timing to raise the on-chain tax is favourable***. 

This proposal is an ***opportunity to renew the chains focus on burning*** and recovery by enhancing the existing deflationary mechanism, to provide a fixed and clear target supply goal, and is put forward to vote for the LUNC communities approval.

### Voting

- Vote **YES** if you agree to ***raise the on-chain tax*** from 0.5% to 1.5%. 

- Vote **NO** if you disagree with raising the on-chain tax to 1.5%. 

- Vote **ABSTAIN** if you neither agree or disagree with raising the on-chain tax to 1.5%, but want to contribute to quorum. 

- Vote **NO WITH VETO** if you strongly disagree with raising the on-chain tax to 1.5%, and wish for the depositors funds to be burned. 

### Implementation: 

If this parameter proposal passes the ***1.5% on-chain tax will be automatically implemented*** at the next on-chain epoch (within 7 days).
